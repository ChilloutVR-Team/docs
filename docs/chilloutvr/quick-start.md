## Upgrading a Steam account into a ChilloutVR account

If you decide to create content or groups, you will need to have a ChilloutVR account. Luckily, the process is quite simple!

1. Go to the [hub](https://hub.chilloutvr.net/login]) and click the button `Sign in with Steam`,
2. It will ask you if you want to sign-in using your steam account,
3. You will then be prompted to migrate you account by providing:
    
    - Email,
    - Password,
    
    ,
4. Then you should receive an email to validate your account,
5. After following the instructions in the email your account should be now a full account.,

You can use either the steam button, or your picked credentials. And also have full access to the Hub, which allows getting your CCK key to upload content, update your profile picture, request username change, etc.
