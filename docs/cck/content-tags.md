# Content Tags

The following contains an overview of the content classification tags provided by the CCK. You are required to tag your
uploaded content accordingly. If you are unsure about a certain tag's meaning you can contact us at any time via email.

!!! tip
    **If in doubt: _tag it_.** It's better to be overly cautious than miss an important tag!

## Disrupting Experience

Tags for effects that change or interrupt normal gameplay, such as screen overlays, flashing visuals, or sudden scares.

### Screen Effects

Content that includes any visual effect that alters, distorts, or overlays the playerâ€™s screen.

Including but not limited to:

- Fullscreen or screen-space shader effects (blur, distortion, chromatic aberration, static, noise)
- Screen overlays that attach to the HUD
- Screen-space animations (pulsing, flashing, color shifts)

### Flashing Effects

When the content contains rapidly flashing/changing elements which may cause
discomfort or photosensitivity.

Including but not limited to flashing/rapidly changing:

- Lights
- Materials
- Textures
- Colors

!!! tip
    The most important reason for this tag's existence is due to health conditions players might have. Make sure to
    use those tags whenever something is rapidly changing or flashing.

### Jumpscare

Content containing sudden visual or audio event designed to startle the user.

A jumpscare is a technique often used in horror films and video games, intended to scare the audience by surprising
them with an abrupt change in image or event, usually co-occurring with a loud, frightening sound.
