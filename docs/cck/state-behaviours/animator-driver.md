!!! tip "Looking for the component version?"
    If you're working with the component that allows you to change parameters in other animators via animations, see the [CVR Animator Driver component](../components/cvr-animator-driver.md).

!!! abstract "Missing Documentation :("
    This component is not documented yet. A page has been created to ensure the CCK does not 404 linking to it.
